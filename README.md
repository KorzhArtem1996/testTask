### Java Developer Coding Task

The coding challenge task is to create a backend for a simple "banking" application:
* Client should be able to sign up with email & password
* Client should be able to deposit money
* Client should be able to withdraw money
* Client should be able to see the account balance and statement
You should create the database structure, backend and REST API.
Technology stack
* Java 8
* Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL or any in-memory database (like H2/HSQLDB)
* Maven or Gradle as build system
* Host your code on GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab public repo
Note: Spring security usage is not necessary.
What we will take into consideration on final valuation:
- How well business requirements are understood and implemented
- Quality of the code (design, legibility, validations)
- Test coverage
- Use of Java 8 features


### Solution

Used technologies:
	- Spring Boot
	- Spring Web
	- Spring Data Jpa
	- Spring Test
	- Embedded in-memory H2 database
	- Embedded Tomcat
	- Maven 
	- Java 8
	- Git

#### I spent about 7-8 hours on solution to this test task
